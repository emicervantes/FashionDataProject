When I received the dress, I feel in love, great quality, material, everything, it was gorgeous...one problem, it was too small, 5 inches from zipping up too small! I was devastated. So of course, I put in an exchange, the employees at Modcloth are great, they walked me through getting it done and even referred me to a sizing specialist! When ordering the exchange, I had to go up to the size 22, now have you, I'm now nervous that the dress is going to be insanely large and I would have to get it tailored, all within 3 days of the event...nope, I get it and it fit like a glove, like the dress had my name on it and was made just for me.

So, I took a chance. Unfortunately, it's just too long, and too...much. I'm 5' 0, so the proportions are just wrong. The lace at the top hits my neck in a weird place (and flops over in the middle as others have mentioned), and the skirt could stand to be 8 shorterno hemming on this dress with that beautiful detail at the bottom. Also, as many other reviewers said, the zipper just doesn't want to zip past the seam at the waist, even with my husband's help. I have a little extra girth around my belly, and I have a pretty short torso, so I ordered a size 6 hoping it would fit in the waist without swimming on the rest of me, but alas, the waist was just a teensy bit too tight, and would not have been comfortable to sit in, while the rest was too big.

10,8535,160625,dresses,37.0,18,5.0,5,46.0,36.0,67.0,5.0,3,Review of the Dress for Women with Curves,"I am a woman with curves. That being said, I wanted to write a helpful review for the woman who are over a size 12. I am a size 14 on a good day but usually am a size 16 which is the size of this dress that I am wearing in these pictures. The wedding I am wearing  it to is at the end of May so this is not the finished look that I will be wearing it was just for the sake of trying it on and writing a review. I love the dress but it can be a bit cupcake like on me especially at the waist where it poofs out a little too much (see pics). There are 3 layers of tule on my dress and I really think they could have gotten the same effect with less tule, especially on more curvy women and then with less tule it would be more slimming. The biggest complaint I have though is the neckline although it's not a deal breaker. When the dress is on me, it in no way matches the look of the model when it comes to the neckline. There is an awkward scalloped detail along the collar bone and so it does not sit flush against the skin. Whereas on the model, it is perfectly flush along her collarbone. I understand this is most likely because I have more broad shoulders and later breasts however, I think the designer should design and sew it in a way so that it looks very similar on all different kinds of figures. My favorite thing about the dress is the color. This color is exquisite and I really like the lace which makes it look really like a  black tie affair look. I also think the fabric is a nice quality. It is not itchy nor irritating and it is something I could wear all night without being annoyed by the fabric. Finally, the best part about the dress, my breasts are size 36 D and I DO NOT have to wear a bra in order for my girls to stay up and look perky. I think that's awesome because of the fact that if I did wear a normal bra, you would absolutely see the bra straps on this dress. I would recommend this look for curvier women but caution you from thinking that it will fit exactly as it fits on the model. If you purchase it, you have to find a way to make it work on you. I am keeping it and plan to wear it to the wedding in about a month so I will post the pictures of my final look after the wedding!",0.2111842105263158,2220,455

Now let's get to the nitty gritty, although the dress is lovely the zipper is a pain. You will surely need to use some muscle to pull it up. As far as the fit, I suggest If you are in between sizes as I am, size up. I am a 34A ,and a size 6 fits well without it being too lose in the chest area.

This dress hit all the check marks, and I got it during one of the sales (win!)I was worried being such a low price, that the fabric would be a little cheap looking or the dress poorly made. But when I opened it, I was really excited to see how delicate and ornate the details were! The bottom half of the gown is really lovely, the top is flattering but conservative, and the side zipper really helps getting the dress on/off. It also has builtin bra pads (which I missed in the info description) so that's a win! I don't think I'll end up needing to wear a bra under the dress which was a concern I had. I only have a few notes to share that I consider really minor and easy to fix: there's 3 layers of tool between the dress and the slip, so it jets out a little more than I like (my hips are about 38, plus poofy dress). I'm considering removing at least one layer to calm it down, but I have a lot of time between now and my wedding so I might change my mind.

Some things I'd suggest if your considering this dress: size up and have it altered, if your over a C cup have the bra padding removed, have the sleeves taken in. This dress is all lace so there is no give. There are several layers of tulle in the skirt..so if your not using this as a wedding dress I'd suggest having some layers removed.

Altering wouldn't have worked and shortening wasn't an option because that would mean cutting off the lovely scalloped bottom. If the dress had some give I would have ordered a small (which is what I usually wear but I think it still might have been too long.)  I'm happy it's worked for others because it really is a oneofakind dress.  I've already sent it back.",0.032137573964497,751,143

What a GREAT DRESS!  I am usually a 3x in Modcloth items although some items tend to run small as the previous reviews reported with the rib cage area on this dress, so I sized up to 4x. When it arrived, I tried it on. I think I might have been able to wear the 3x. Although the photos all show the sleeves to be quite closely fitting even the ends and I didn't want them to be too tight my arms are a problem area. The 4x fits exactly right there and the ends of the sleeves don't cling. I feel loose and comfortable & I can move my arms easily. My bust fits a tick loose the waist more (which is where a 3x would have been okay but with an easy alteration or even a belt I can cinch that waist. It's got a nice weight to it and feels really good on, not itchy or stiff. It's a beautiful dress it makes me so happy just looking at it. The mesh is really fine so be careful of snagging it on things like hang nails, jewelry and such. My upper arms measure 16in at the heaviest part.

The fabric has a nice weight to it and does not feel cheap at all (which it shouldn't for the price). I'm 5'6, around 145, 32B,pear shaped and I got this in a medium. I always gravitate to aline and fit and flare dresses as they look best on my shape and this one does not disappoint. The waist hits right at my natural waist and hugs my upper body then flares away from my tummy area without looking poofy. I do not have much extra room in the bust so I would be cautious if you have a large bustoverall size ratio. The length is exactly what I like and hits just barely (like 1/2 inch) above my knees. This definitely gives you more length than many other dresses. It's fully lined with a teal, stretchy underlay. This also feels fairly substantial and not like it will move around or scooch up on you as you wear it. The teal color is not super obvious but makes the lace stand out more. The dress is still overall a green/pine color. The neckline is very narrow for lack of a better word so I generally wouldn't want to wear anything but a delicate, short necklace with it. It has nice thick straps and the back does not swoop in at all on the shoulder blade area so you and easily wear a normal bra. it has a hidden back zipper that goes very far down so it's easy to get on. The zipper is just a little hard to zip I think because of the fact that it is hidden and the lace is not an even surface for it move against.Again, overall it is a beautiful dress and seems well made, I'm soooo glad I bought it.

I read the reviews and was expecting sheer fabric, but since it came with a slip I figured it'd be okay. The fabric is not just sheer, though, it's well and truly flimsy, so much so that the ruffled collar can't support itself and drapes awkwardly around your neck. The armholes are also massive, on the dress and the slip, and gape terribly  but if I'd gone down a size, it'd be tight in the hips. I tried to fix this by sewing darts under the sleeves, but because it also zips all the way up one side, I'm having to add four darts total  to either side of each seam  and I think I'm also going to have to tuck the loose ends of the collar along the neckline and sew them in for a more finished look. For what a flimsy dress this is and how much altering it needs to work, it's just not worth the price. Too bad  I wore it (work in progress style under a cardigan to hide the sleeve issues) and got lots of compliments on the fabulous print.",-0.0200583367250033,1054,209

I'm 5'3 and a small hits me well below the knee, while the square neckline is high enough to cover my 32D cleavage professionally, so it's a great work dress in a brilliant power color.BUT. It is cut super weirdly, as others have said in their reviews. If you lay the dress flat, the shoulder straps are set wider than the dress's waist. And this is a highwaisted dress, so the waist is actually hitting at lower ribcage area. Translation: If your shoulders aren't broader than your ribs, the straps are not going to stay on your shoulders. There's no good way to cinch them together without causing gaping in the back.For those who want the dress anyway, the best solution I found was to make sure the dress is pulled down as low as possible on my body to maximize tension in the straps, and then use fashion tape to secure the straps in place the way you would if you were wearing some a backless deepcleavage halter dress.

I have a hard time finding flattering formal dresses because I basically have no hips, so there's usually a spark of anxiety before events, but I digress. So the fabric is very nice and soft, but it looks and feels high quality. The dress does have a bit of stretch, but I found the XL was just a *touch* on the larger side for me in the waist  (I prefer some breathing room, so no complaints). My biggest issue was the length ? I'm 5'0, so this is always my issue with all clothing. It initially hit right below my knee, which is a little matronly looking on me because, y'all, my legs are like 2 feet long. But once I shortened the straps by quite a bit, it hit right at my knee and of course made the top a bit more modest, so it was perfect. Despite the minor fit issues, I'm giving it 5 stars because of how flattering it was! It just fell so perfectly and gave me a defined waist. It made the girls look pretty darn good.

The collar is bigger than it appears in the pictures  definitely a statement collar  and my girlfriend told me I looked like I was on the Brady Bunch  but 'in a good way'. I rated the fit slightly large because I had some extra room through the chest.

The fabric on my dress is thick and has a nice drape, and I personally love the full skirt (note: for those of you who are squeamish about appearing curvy, full skirts do enhance hips). The waist sits are my natural waist and the skirt hits just below my knees. The pockets are a practical touch, while the belt is nice looking and average quality, although the material on the back is already showing creases where it was folded for shipping. As for packaging, the box arrived somewhat beat up and the dress was horribly wrinkled and smelled like chemicals. A quick run through the washing machine seems to have gotten rid of both wrinkles and smell, however, and there is no sign whatsoever of fading or pilling. I do find that the top is quite large, which can be attended to somewhat by cinching the straps as tight as they will go. However, for anything less than a C cup, you would probably need to have the top taken in a bit. For me, the straps are my least favourite part of the dress (and why I' giving it only 4 stars) and I may look into replacing them entirely with something thicker and more mature. I will also need to wear a camisole underneath for work, but paired with any number of the Cream of the Crop cardigans that Modcloth sells, this dress is a great addition to the work wardrobe. Or, you could throw on some heals and wear it for an evening out.

For the most part, it doesn't disappoint!  My one real complaint is that I can fully reach around my own back and can do most zippers and ties myself, but I can't quite get this to sit right when I do the bow on my own.  I think it can be /made/ to sit right so I don't think it's a flaw in the dress?  But I'll need help to get into it.  That aside, the colors are spoton, the liner is fun and reminds me of watermelon.  Be warned that I'm usually somewhere between S and XS on Modcloth and I had a hard time getting the elastic of this S over my hips.  It didn't stretch completely out but I was worried, so I'd recommend putting it on over your head even though the top comes completely undone.",0.234672619047619,840,169

The large fit just right in the waist  not to snug, not too loose. But the top portion was so awkward. It was loose around my back and my chest didn't fill out the top correctly. It just felt so big! Mind you, I wear a 32DDD but my chest really isn't as big as my bra size makes the girls sound (postbreastfeeding size, not originally this big.. they need major support). So this top might be good for truly large chested girls but if you're not super wellendowed or your ladies just need a ton of support, I'd size down. OR buy both sizes and return the one that doesn't fit best.ANYWAY.... So I got the medium instead and it fits MUCH better on the top but is pretty snug in the waist. I can only secure the belt to the second loop hole. That being said and since this dress is also 100% cotton, it will need to be washed/cared for appropriately to avoid major shrinking.As far as the material quality  SO GOOD! This is probably the best quality modcloth label purchase I've bought in a long time. The fabric is heavy but still perfect for summer. It's lined. And it feels/looks expensive. AND IT HAS POCKETS!

I read all the reviews and I was in between sizes L and XL so I bought both to try on and return one. with the XL it has enough room for my bust (36DD/DDD) but it was a little large else where. under the bust is some elastic which is nice. the L fit every but was a little snug in the bust. the girls were squished. the large would probably fit a C or D cup better. I ended up returning the XL and keeping the L just because I'm in the process of losing weight and the large for everywhere else. I can try a sports bra to better accommodate the girls. the fabric is a little loose up top which is flattering. the dress is slimming. the patter is adorable! the length is great.

And given that the embroidered section sits slightly away from the lining, I think it would look weird if I embroidered over it straight through the liner.  :(  really cute dress though and the flare is so nice.",0.015359477124183,789,147

The outer layer is very silky and would be very sheer if it wasn't a dark color. Here's where this gets weird. The lining isn't super large in the chest but the outer layer is. I could have several inches taken out of the top outer layer and then this would be much less of a sack.

The size 8 was too big and the size 6 was perfect, maybe even too tights in the shoulders. When I was ordering the dresses, the white one was not available in size 6 or 8. On Wednesday, I checked and it was available in those sizes. So I decided to order the white in 6 and I did ASAP shipping. Ordered it on Wednesday and got it Friday. The dress was beautiful. But the sizes are not always identical. The white dress in size 6 was slightly bigger than the navy dress in size 6. With the navy dress, it was a little tight even without a bra. For my wedding day, I wore the white dress without a bra and throughout the day, the dress loosened up. Maybe I should have worn a bra but I really do not care.Also, for some reason the zipper would not zip all the way every time.

I'm still keeping it because it is cute, I just wish they'd post better pictures so I could see this because I would prefer the white version I thought it was. I also wish Modcloth would get their sizing consistent, because this one and the Retro Bloom Intarsia size L fit me, but the yellow one with white cat heads size M fits me better, even though they are the same brand and sweater, just with different designs.

The material is relatively thin, not see through thin, and there is a blue silk like slip underneath that layer which really adds to the quality, Definitely a must have skirt that can become a classic that I will wear for several years (only time will tell). The only downside I say about this is that I wished the length was just inch or so shorter as personal preference.

I tried these on as a Modcloth Employee and having tried on quite a few similar pairs that didn't quite hit the mark I really like the fit on these pants. I have a naturally smaller waist compared to how curvy I am on the bottom so pants are usually problematic but with the tie, it helped the usual gaping I experience.

I'm fine boned and tall but have wider hip bones and also full thighs and seat. Anyway, I've recently graduated to a size US8 dress size, but sometimes find jeans a wee bit squeezy in size 8. The L in this model is near perfect for me  no muffin tops or tightness anywhere, just a nice formfitting feel. The only 'con' with the L for me is quite a bit of gaping at the back waist, which I'll fix with a bit of elastic inserted on the inside of the back waistband. For reference, I'm 29 (ish) waist, 39 hips, and 34 mid abdomen, which is where this waistband sits. The denim has a small amount of stretch and is quite soft.I had hoped these jeans would be high waisted, as they looked to be in the photos, but they are not, they are mid rise. I do think it would be useful if the front rise measurement were provided on all pants (front rise on these is 10, high waist would have to be 11.512).

It doesn't look bad but I can't feel confident while wearing this. I'll always be checking for hair, lint, wrinkles, and wondering if my shoulders are too big. Might be going back. Sigh.
